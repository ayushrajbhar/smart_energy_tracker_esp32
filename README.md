## üåü Project Overview

The **Smart Energy Tracker** solves the problem of inefficient electricity usage and high financial costs by:
- Monitoring household device electricity consumption using **IoT sensors** (ACS712 and ZMPT101B).
- Using **machine learning** to predict future electricity bills based on historical data and user behavior.
- Detecting **irregular consumption patterns** to provide alerts about potential hazards such as faulty appliances or unsafe usage.
- Educating users about the **environmental impact** of their energy consumption, thereby promoting energy conservation.

The core system gathers real-time electricity data, processes it, and provides insights into usage patterns, helping users optimize energy consumption and avoid potential risks.
